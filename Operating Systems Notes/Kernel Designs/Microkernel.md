#kernel #TODO 

Work in progress, all I can say for now is that it's the opposite of what a [[Monolithic Kernel]] would be. As the name suggests the **kernel space** is kept as tiny as possible, trying to run most of its services in **user space**, all that's left for the kernel are basic services.

Also refer to [[OS-structure.svg]] which explains the whole thing pretty well.
