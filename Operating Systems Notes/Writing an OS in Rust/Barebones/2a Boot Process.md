### BIOS & UEFI
Firmware standards on **x86**, the *Basic Input Output System* (old) and the *Unified Extensible Firmware Interface* (new)

## What happens when you boot
1. BIOS gets loaded from flash memory located on motherboard
2. BIOS runs self-test and initialization routines of hardware
3. BIOS looks for bootable disks
4. If successful, control transferred to the [[Bootloader]]

### What the [[Bootloader]] does
1. It determines the location of the Kernel image, then loads it into memory
2. Switch from 16-Bit [[Real Mode]] to 32-Bit [[Protected Mode]] and then to 64-Bit [[Long Mode]]
