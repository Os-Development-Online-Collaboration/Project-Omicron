#DataStructure

Operating systems are replete with various important **data structures**. The **process list** (also called the **task list**) is one of the very important ones. It is one of the simpler ones, but certainly any OS that has the ability to run multiple programs at once will have something akin to this structure in order to keep track of all the running programs in the system. Sometimes people refer to the individual structure that stores information about a process as a **Process Control Block (PCB)**, a fancy way of talking about a C structure that contains information about each process (also sometimes called a **process descriptor**).
