#Policy 

A scheduling policy in the OS will make the decision about how to scheduling resources.

Often scheduling policies can make use of historical information (e.g. which program has run more over the last minute?), workload knowledge (e.g., what types of programs are run), and performance metrics (e.g., is the system optimizing for interactive performance, or throughput?) to make its decision.
