#Mechanism 

The counterpart of [[Abstractions/Mechanisms/Time Sharing|Time Sharing]] is **Space Sharing**, where a resource is divided (in space) among those who wish to use it. For example, disk space is naturally a space-shared resource; once a block is assigned to a file, it is normally not assigned to another file until the user deletes the original file.
