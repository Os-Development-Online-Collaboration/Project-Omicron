#Tip 

Even though we have taken great pains to protect the OS during system calls (by adding a hardware trapping mechanism, and ensuring all calls to the OS are routed through it), there are still many other aspects to implementing a secure operating system that we must consider. One of these is the handling of arguments at the system call boundary; the OS must check what the user passes in and ensure that arguments are properly specified, or otherwise reject the call. For example, with a write() system call, the user specifies an address of a buffer as a source of the write call. If the user (either accidentally or maliciously) passes in a “bad” address (e.g., one inside the kernel’s portion of the address space), the OS must detect this and reject the call. Otherwise, it would be possible for a user to read all of kernel memory; given that kernel (virtual) memory also usually includes all of the physical memory of the system, this small slip would enable a program to read the memory of any other process in the system. In general, a secure system must treat user inputs with great suspicion. Not doing so will undoubtedly lead to easily hacked software, a despairing sense that the world is an unsafe and scary place, and the loss of job security for the all-too-trusting OS developer.
