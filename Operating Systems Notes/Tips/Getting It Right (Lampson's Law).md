#Tip 

As Lampson states in his well-regarded “Hints for Computer Systems Design”, “Get it right. Neither abstraction nor simplicity is a substitute for getting it right.” Sometimes, you just have to do the right thing, and when you do, it is way better than the alternatives. There are lots of ways to design APIs for process creation; however, the combination of fork() and exec() are simple and immensely powerful. Here, the UNIX designers simply got it right. And because Lampson so often “got it right”, we name the law in his honor.
