#Tip 

With dynamic relocation, a little hardware goes a long way. Namely, a base register is used to transform virtual addresses (generated by the program) into physical addresses. A bounds (or limit) register ensures that such addresses are within the confines of the address space. Together they provide a simple and efficient virtualization of memory.
