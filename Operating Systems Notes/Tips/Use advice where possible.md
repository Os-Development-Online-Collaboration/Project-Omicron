#Tip 

As the operating system rarely knows what is best for each and every process of the system, it is often useful to provide interfaces to allow users or administrators to provide some hints to the OS. We often call such hints advice, as the OS need not necessarily pay attention to it, but rather might take the advice into account in order to make a better decision. Such hints are useful in many parts of the OS, including the scheduler (e.g., with nice), memory manager (e.g., madvise), and file system (e.g., informed prefetching and caching).
