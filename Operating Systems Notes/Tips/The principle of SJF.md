#Tip 

Shortest Job First represents a general scheduling principle that can be applied to any system where the perceived turnaround time per customer (or, in our case, a job) matters. Think of any line you have waited in: if the establishment in question cares about customer satisfaction, it is likely they have taken SJF into account. For example, grocery stores commonly have a “ten-items-or-less” line to ensure that shoppers with only a few things to purchase don’t get stuck behind the family preparing for some upcoming nuclear winter.
