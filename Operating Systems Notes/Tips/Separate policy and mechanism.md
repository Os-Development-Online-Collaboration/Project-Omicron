#Tip 

In many operating systems, a common design paradigm is to separate high-level policies from their low-level mechanisms. You can think of the mechanism as providing the answer to a how question about a system; for example, how does an operating system perform a context switch? The policy provides the answer to a which question; for example, which process should the operating system run right now? Separating the two allows one easily to change policies without having to rethink the mechanism and is thus a form of modularity, a general software design principle.
