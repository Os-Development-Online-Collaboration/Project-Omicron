#Tip 

In many cases, a list will do. In many cases, it will not. Knowing which data structure to use when is a hallmark of good engineering. In the case discussed herein, simple lists found in earlier schedulers simply do not work well on modern systems, particular in the heavily loaded servers found in datacenters. Such systems contain thousands of active processes; searching through a long list to find the next job to run on each core every few milliseconds would waste precious CPU cycles. A better structure was needed, and CFS provided one by adding an excellent implementation of a red-black tree. More generally, when picking a data structure for a system you are building, carefully consider its access patterns and its frequency of usage; by understanding these, you will be able to implement the right structure for the task at hand.
