#Tip 

One of the most powerful (and basic) mechanisms in the design of lottery (and stride) scheduling is that of the ticket. The ticket is used to represent a process’s share of the CPU in these examples, but can be applied much more broadly. For example, in more recent work on virtual memory management for hypervisors, Waldspurger shows how tickets can be used to represent a guest operating system’s share of memory. Thus, if you are ever in need of a mechanism to represent a proportion of ownership, this concept just might be ... (wait for it) ... the ticket.
