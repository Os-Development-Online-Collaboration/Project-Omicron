#Tip 

The general technique of amortization is commonly used in systems when there is a fixed cost to some operation. By incurring that cost less often (i.e., by performing the operation fewer times), the total cost to the system is reduced. For example, if the time slice is set to 10 ms, and the context-switch cost is 1 ms, roughly 10% of time is spent context switching and is thus wasted. If we want to amortize this cost, we can increase the time slice, e.g., to 100 ms. In this case, less than 1% of time is spent context switching, and thus the cost of time-slicing has been amortized.
