#Tip 

Isolation is a key principle in building reliable systems. If two entities are properly isolated from one another, this implies that one can fail without affecting the other. Operating systems strive to isolate processes from each other and in this way prevent one from harming the other. By using memory isolation, the OS further ensures that running programs cannot affect the operation of the underlying OS. Some modern OSâ€™s take isolation even further, by walling off pieces of the OS from other pieces of the OS. Such microkernels thus may provide greater reliability than typical monolithic kernel designs.
