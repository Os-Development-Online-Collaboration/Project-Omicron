#Tip 

You might think that a scheduling policy, whether inside the OS itself (as discussed herein), or in a broader context (e.g., in a distributed storage systemâ€™s I/O request handling), is not a security concern, but in increasingly many cases, it is exactly that. Consider the modern datacenter, in which users from around the world share CPUs, memories, networks, and storage systems; without care in policy design and enforcement, a single user may be able to adversely harm others and gain advantage for itself. Thus, scheduling policy forms an important part of the security of a system, and should be carefully constructed.
