# What is it
BIOS is an acronym for "Basic Input/Output System" and was created to offer low-level services to early PC system programmers. 

## Aims
- To hide (as much as possible) variations in PC models and hardware from the OS and applications
- To make OS and application development easier (because BIOS services handled most of the hardware level interface)

# Usage
The BIOS services are still used (especially during bootup) and are often named "BIOS functions". 

In [[Real Mode]] the BIOS functions can be easily accessed through [[Software Interrupts]], using Assembly language.
